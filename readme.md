This repository contains an in implementation to get OpenBCI biodata into MaxMSP using OSC.

OpenBCI is a company that produces open-source equipment for recording biosignals such as EEG (brain activity), EMG (muscle activity), and ECG (heart activity). This data is streamed into your computer via a USB Serial port, where you can then access the raw data for analysis, visualization, etc.

This guide shows you a way to stream OpenBCI data into Max MSP in order to explore creative ways to work with brain signals. To run this tutorial, you will need:

1. Python 2.7 
2. Max MSP

# Setup
## Download the repository
This repository contains the files you will need to run in order to start streaming data and sending it to MaxMSP. 

**Two methods:** 

  1. **Method One**: Type `git clone https://github.com/gabrielibagon/OpenBCI_MATLAB.git` on the command line

  2. **Method Two**: Click "Clone or download" near the top right of the page, and click "Download Zip". Unzip the file into a directory of your choice

## Python Setup
  1. [Download Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) (either version 2.7 or 3.5) onto your computer.
